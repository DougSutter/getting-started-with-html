  <b>The Basics of the Web and HTML</b>
<br>
<br>The world wide web is made up of HTML documents (Hyper Text Markup Language).<br>
It uses hyperlinks or links to glue it all together and was created in the early 90's.<br>
The major pieces of the web are:
You, your computer and web browser, the internet, and the servers that host different types of files, such as images, videos, and documents.
The web uses HTTP (Hyper Text Transport Protocol).<br>
<br>
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is used to create web pages.
HTML markup uses elements that are made up of tags, content and attributes.<br>
<br>
There are many differnt types of tags such as b for bold, em (emphasis) for italics, br for line break
and p for paragraph. You can use a hyperlink tag to insert links such as <a href="att.com">www.att.com</a> to link to a webpage. But don't forget to use "A" for anchor!<br>
<br>
You can also insert images without a closing tag such as a super cool <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="hipmunk!"> hipmunk (not really sure what that is.)<br>
<br>
All whitespace becomes a single line, so you can use br or p to create new lines and paragraphs.
